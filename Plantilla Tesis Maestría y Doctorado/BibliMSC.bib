The algorithm for partitioning of a graph into simple paths of iterative and each iteration produces a new path between two vertices already on paths. (The start vertex can be specified dynamically.) If V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges, each algorithm requires time and space proportional to max (V, E) when executed on a random access computer.},

The algorithm may be viewed as an iterative version of a method originally proposed by Auslander and Parter and correctly formulated by Goldstein. The algorithm used depth-first search and has O(V) time and space bounds, where V is the number of vertices in G. An ALGOL implementation of the algorithm succesfully tested graphs with as many as 900 vertices in less than 12 seconds.},
